# Setup
Before you start anything, please complete the checklist.

* Make sure you have pip and Python installed.*
* Install Scratchattach by running pip install scratchattach
* Make an account** in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) if you don't have one already. Remember your details.
* Have fun!

IMPORTANT: Made for: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/851418630/

FEATURES at https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/README.md
* If you don't have Python, get it at the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads) and find your device's OS there. Then install pip (usually preinstalled with Python, check with `pip --version`) using `python get-pip.py` for windows, `sudo apt install python3-pip`  for linux. ** To change your settings or delete your account, go to the [settings page](https://scratch.mit.edu/accounts/settings/). IMPORTANT: You NEED the "Scratcher" status to use cloud variables. Go to your profile page (scratch.mit.edu/users/[YOUR USERNAME HERE]) and look to the right of your username, and it willneed to say "Scratch Team" (For people who actually code Scratch) or "Scratcher". NOT "new scratcher", otherwise nothing would work except items on the list below not needing the Scratcher status. (To know when you get that status, the Scratch Team will message you inviting you to upgrade to the Scratcher status)

# Running the code
Note: If you need to enter the project ID, look at the number in the Scratch project's url. That's the project ID.
#
#### Event-test.py
#
To run this, first download it and open in the Python app, or my personal favorite, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then run it and look at the [Scratch example page](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/851418630/). This file is made so if you Press one of the buttons that change the variable "test2", it will show a message in the output of the file.
#
#### Variable-changer.py
#
Same as the previous one, just download and run with your favorite python interpreter.
